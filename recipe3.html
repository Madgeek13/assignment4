            <h5 class="in">Instructions</h5>

            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Cut the stalks and leaves off of the cauliflower. Cut the cauliflower into bite-sized florets. Add the cauliflower to a large pan as well as the 2 Tbsp of Grass-fed Butter, 1/2 tsp Himalayan salt, and water. Place on medium/high heat and cover with a lid.</li>

                <li> Let the cauliflower steam in the pan mostly tender. Repeatedly check the water levels to make sure that it doesn't all evaporate. When almost tender, remove the lid and let the cauliflower saute for a few minutes, or until lightly brown. Turn heat off, cover, and keep warm until "cheese" sauce is ready. </li>

                <li>In a saucepan heat 2 Tbsp of Grass-fed Butter over medium/high heat. Add the sqquash, carrot, onion, garlic powder, mustard, and salt to the melted butter.</li>

                <li>Saute until the onion is translucent. Add the can of coconut milk to the saucepan and bring to a simmer. Allow to simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the vegtables are tender and the coconut milk has reduced by 2/3 and is thick.</li>

                <li>Pour the vegetables and coconut milk into a blender and puree until it becomes smooth. Immediately add the egg yolk to the puree and blend well, the hot puree will cook the egg. </li>

                <li>Check seasonings and add more salt or pepper to taste.</li>

                <li>Pour "cheese" sauce over the hot cauliflower and toss to coat. Your Whole Food "Mac &amp; Cheese" is ready to eat!</li>
